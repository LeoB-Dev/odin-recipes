<h3>A traditional British meal consisting of roasted meat, potatoes, and accompaniments such as Yorkshire pudding, vegetables, and gravy.</h3>

<p>To make a classic roast dinner, start by selecting your meat of choice, such as beef, chicken, lamb, or pork. Season the meat with salt, pepper, and herbs like rosemary or thyme, then place it in a roasting pan. Surround the meat with peeled and chopped potatoes, carrots, and parsnips, tossing them in a bit of oil and seasoning. Roast the meat and vegetables in a preheated oven at 180째C (350째F) until the meat reaches the desired internal temperature and the vegetables are tender and golden brown.</p>

<p>While the meat rests, make the gravy by using the drippings from the roasting pan. Place the pan on the stove, add a bit of flour to the drippings, and cook, stirring constantly, to form a roux. Gradually add stock, continuing to stir until the gravy thickens. Serve the sliced meat and roasted vegetables with the gravy, Yorkshire puddings, and steamed green vegetables like peas or broccoli for a complete roast dinner.</p>
