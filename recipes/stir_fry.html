    <h3>A quick and easy Asian-inspired dish typically made with vegetables, meat, or tofu, saut√©ed in a wok with a flavorful sauce.</h3>

    <p>To make a simple stir fry, start by preparing your ingredients: slice your choice of vegetables (such as bell peppers, broccoli, carrots, and snow peas) and protein (such as chicken, beef, shrimp, or tofu). Heat a wok or large skillet over high heat and add a small amount of oil with a high smoke point, like vegetable or sesame oil. Once the oil is hot, add your protein and stir-fry until it's nearly cooked through. Remove the protein from the wok and set it aside.</p>

    <p>In the same wok, add a bit more oil if needed and toss in the vegetables. Stir-fry the vegetables until they are crisp-tender, then return the protein to the wok. Pour in a sauce made from soy sauce, oyster sauce, garlic, ginger, and a bit of sugar or honey. Stir everything together and cook until the sauce is well combined and heated through. Serve the stir fry over steamed rice or noodles, garnished with sesame seeds or chopped green onions.</p>
