<h3>A dish of Italian origin consisting of a flat, round base of dough baked with a topping of tomato sauce and cheese, typically with added meat or vegetables.</h3>

<p>To make a traditional Italian Margherita pizza, start by dissolving fresh yeast in lukewarm water, then mix in all-purpose flour, salt, and olive oil to form a dough. Knead the dough until smooth and elastic, then let it rise until it doubles in size. Once risen, divide the dough, roll it out into thin circles, and top with crushed San Marzano tomatoes, fresh mozzarella pieces, and basil leaves. Drizzle with olive oil and bake in a very hot oven (preferably on a pizza stone) until the crust is golden and the cheese is bubbly, usually around 8-10 minutes. Finish with a drizzle of olive oil, more fresh basil, and a sprinkle of salt.</p>
    
<p>The result is a classic Margherita pizza with a crisp yet chewy crust, rich tomato flavor, creamy melted mozzarella, and fresh basil aroma, embodying the simple yet delicious essence of Italian cuisine.</p>

<h4>Ingredients</h4>

    <li>325ml lukewarm water</li>
    <li>10g salt</li>
    <li>3g fresh yeast (or 1g active dry yeast)</li>

<h4>Steps</h4>

<ol>
    <li>In a large mixing bowl, dissolve the yeast in lukewarm water and let it sit for a few minutes until it starts to froth. </li>
    <li>Gradually add the flour, mixing with your hands or a wooden spoon until a dough begins to form.</li>
    <li>Add the salt and olive oil, then transfer the dough onto a floured surface and knead for about 10 minutes until it becomes smooth and elastic. </li>
    <li>Place the dough back into the bowl, cover it with a damp cloth, and let it rise in a warm place for about 1-2 hours, or until it has doubled in size.</li>
    <li>Preheat your oven to its highest setting, ideally around 250°C (482°F), with a pizza stone inside if you have one. </li>
    <li>Punch down the risen dough and divide it into two equal parts. Tear the mozzarella into pieces and distribute it evenly over the tomato sauce. Add a few basil leaves and drizzle with olive oil. Bake the pizza on the preheated stone or baking sheet for 8-10 minutes, or until the crust is golden and the cheese is bubbly. Once out of the oven, add a few more fresh basil leaves, a drizzle of olive oil, and a sprinkle of salt before serving. Buon appetito!</li>
    <li>Roll out each portion into a thin circle on a floured surface.</li>
    <li> Spread a thin layer of crushed San Marzano tomatoes over the dough, leaving a small border around the edges. </li>
